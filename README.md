## Pizza Sales Project with SQL and Power BI

In this Pizza Sales Analysis project, I harnessed the power of SQL and Power BI to meticulously explore the sales data of a pizza company spanning an entire year. With an analytical lens, I delved deep into the dataset, aiming to unravel essential insights that could steer strategic decisions and enhance overall business performance. Through a methodical approach, I answered critical questions that formed the backbone of this analysis:

### Project Objectives:

Best-Selling Pizzas: By dissecting sales figures, I identified the top-performing pizzas, shedding light on the flavors and recipes that resonated most with customers. This knowledge informs inventory management and marketing strategies, ensuring the company meets customer demands efficiently.

Peak Months and Days: Pinpointing the highest sales months and most lucrative days, this analysis reveals the temporal patterns in customer behaviour. Understanding these trends aids in optimising staffing, supply chains, and promotional activities.

Pizza Size Preferences: By scrutinising the sales data for different pizza sizes, I determined the most popular and least favoured sizes. This insight is invaluable for pricing strategies, helping the company cater to diverse customer preferences while maximising profits.

Top and Bottom Performers: Through detailed analysis, I identified the star performers in the companyâ€™s pizza lineup as well as the underperforming varieties. This knowledge equips the company to capitalise on its strengths and address the weaknesses in its product offerings.

Interactive Dashboard: The insights derived from this analysis are meticulously visualised in an interactive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard not only provides a clear snapshot of the findings but also serves as a dynamic tool for ongoing decision-making, enabling stakeholders to explore the data intuitively.
